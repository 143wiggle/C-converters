Summary:
Why (int) is used:
â€¢	(int)(totalInches / 12):
This converts the total number of inches into feet. 
Since a foot is 12 inches, we divide the total inches by 12. 
The result of this division might have a fractional part (e.g., 8.5 feet). 
By casting it to an int,
we drop the decimal part and only keep the whole number part (8 feet).
